Since the dawn of time, civilizations rise and fall, philosophers come and go, but mankind has never given up on trying to solve the classical questions of philosophy: 
-	Who am I? 
-	Where am I from? 
-	Where am I going? 
-	What should I eat tonight? (the most difficult one)

And just as the name, which is word-by-word translated from the classical Asian quote “Tối nay ăn gì” (also known as 晚上吃啥/今夜は何が食べたいですか), the project serves one and only philosophical purpose - to find out what to eat for dinner.
